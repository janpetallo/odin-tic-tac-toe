# odin-tic-tac-toe

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game that I made as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It is a two-player game where players take turns to place their marks on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

The project requirments can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).

## How to play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Click on the grid to place your mark.
4. The game will automatically switch turns between players.
5. The game will end when a player wins or the grid is full.

Alternatively, you can play the game [here](https://janpetallo.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/).
